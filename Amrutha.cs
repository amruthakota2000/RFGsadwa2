// COP 4365 â€“ Spring 2022
//
// Homework #4: The Traffic Study
//
// Description: In this problem we are required to create a program with having emergency vehicle signals and have two signals be the same color at the same time. We used a timer in this program to change the signal lights
//              Then the program analyzes all the cars that come from the 4 directions and prints data on the average wait time, maximum number of cars and so on.
